## Ai-Cooking-Chatbot (aka CookBot)

*Ai-Cooking-Chatbot, also called **CookBot*, is an AI-powered cooking assistant that combines a React/TypeScript frontend, a Flask/Python backend, MongoDB storage, and OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 to help users chat, get recipes, save them, and manage cooking sessions in style.

### Features

#### *Frontend (React + TypeScript)*

* Sleek, responsive chat interface with light/dark mode toggle.
* Real-time messaging with typing indicators.
* Recipes rendered into structured cards: titles, ingredient lists, instructions.
* Click-to-copy ingredients feature.
* Save and later retrieve recipes with bookmark icons.
* Mobile-first design.

#### *Backend (Flask + Python)*

* Integrated with OpenAI GPT-3.5 to process cooking queries using a custom prompt.
* MongoDB stores chat sessions and saved recipes.
* REST API endpoints for chat interactions and recipe handling.
* Supports session tracking, CORS, and environment-based configuration.

### Setup Instructions

#### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18+) and npm
* Python (v3.8+)
* MongoDB (local or Mongo Atlas)
* OpenAI API key

#### Backend Setup

1. cd backend
2. Create virtual environment:

   bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   
3. Install Python dependencies:

   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
4. Configure environment variables:

   bash
   cp .env.example .env
   

   Fill in:

   
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   
5. Ensure MongoDB is running (locally or via cloud).
6. Run backend:

   bash
   python app.py
   

   → Backend now available at http://localhost:5000.

#### Frontend Setup

1. From project root, run:

   bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   

   → Frontend hosted at http://localhost:5173.
